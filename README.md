# Fred's Fights! (STARWARS FFA/Duels) Rules

## Player Count Rules
- **LESS THAN 8 Players:**  
  - Duels-only — no FFA.   
  - *Flourish (press X+1) before each duel.*  
  - Wait your turn — respect ongoing duels.  
  - Do not interfere, even if you are in a faction (Jedi, Sith, etc.).

- **8 Players OR MORE:**  
  - FFA is permitted *only* in the main areas of the map.  
  - Duel zones are still reserved for 1v1s and must remain free of FFA.  
  - Enter duel zones only if you intend to 1v1 and flourish first.

## Duel Zone Etiquette
- Use teleports to access duel arenas.
- Always **flourish (X+1)** before engaging in a duel.
- Do not attack anyone inside duel zones unless a duel has been initiated.
- Killing or harassing duelists in these zones will result in a warning or ban.
