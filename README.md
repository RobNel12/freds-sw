### 📜 **Rules of the Server**

1. **Don't be an ass**  
   Trash talk is okay — abuse and bullying are not. No prejudice or discrimination of any kind.

2. **Keep FFA out of the main dueling areas**  
   You can FFA and mutual RDM, but not near duels or in main duel zones.

3. **No Random Deathmatch (RDM)**  
   *Flourish before fighting* and wait for one in return. Revenge RDM is also not allowed.

4. **Don't interrupt duels**  
   No bodyblocking or swinging near duelists — even a miss can trigger a parry.

5. **Fight with honor**  
   - No healing with `.food` during fights  
   - No quick starting  
   - Let your opponent heal to full before resuming, unless they opt out
