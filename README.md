# Fred's Fights! (STARWARS FFA/Duels) Rules - MUST READ
## Player Count Rules
**LESS THAN 8 Players:**  
  - Duels-only — no FFA.   
  - Flourish (press X+1) before each duel.
  - Wait your turn — respect ongoing duels.  
  - Do not interfere, even if you are in a faction (Jedi, Sith, etc.).

**8 Players OR MORE:**  
  - FFA is permitted everywhere *except* duel zones (defined by tp duel/duel2/etc.)
  - Duel zones are still reserved for 1v1s and must remain free of FFA.  
  - Enter duel zones only if you intend to 1v1 and flourish first.

## Duel Zone Etiquette
- Use teleports to access duel arenas.
- Always **flourish (X+1)** before engaging in a duel.
- Do not attack anyone inside duel zones unless a duel has been initiated.
- Killing or harassing duelists in these zones will result in a warning or ban.

## Faction Gameplay Guidelines
Players are encouraged to fight in **faction-themed teams** in FFA areas:
- **SITH:** Red lightsabers
- **JEDI:** All other sabers (except the Darksaber!!)
- **NEUTRAL:** Darksaber, any other weapon

**DO NOT TEAM SWITCH:** If you're a sith and lose your saber, but pick up a jedi color, you're still a sith! You are encouraged to DRESS ACCORDINGLY to make identification easier.

Feel free to **team up within your faction** for coordinated FFA.
Be willing to go against the grain.
  - EXAMPLE: If everyone is a droid, and they're ganking the rest of the server, organize a clone or Jedi army!

## Prohibited Behavior
- No attacking in duel zones unless dueling.
- No spawnkilling or camping teleports.
- No intentional teamkilling or trolling your own faction/group
- Toxic behavior, racism, slurs, and harassment will result in instant bans.

## Final Note
This is a themed server meant to celebrate *Star Wars* and encourage creative roleplay within combat. Play fair, respect others, and **may the Force be with you.**
