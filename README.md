# Fred's Fights! (STAR WARS FFA/Duels) Rules – MUST READ

## Core Concept
This is a **duel-first Star Wars server** with separate **FFA zones** for when you want chaos.  
**Duels come first** — respectful 1v1s are the core of this server.  
**Faction play is encouraged in FFA**, but not required.  
Custom loadouts are expected. You’re here to fight and look cool doing it.

---

## DUELS (Default Gameplay)
- This is a **duel-only server by default**.
- **Flourish (X + 1)** before any duel — no exceptions.
- Wait your turn. Don’t third-party. Don’t loiter near an active duel.
- Interrupting duels or ganking = warning or ban.

---

## FFA ZONES
- Specific areas are marked for **FFA** (teleporters or map-marked).
- **FFA zones = Kill on Sight** (Faction-teaming is encouraged)
---

## FACTIONS (FFA ONLY)

Factions are **optional** in FFA

In FFA zones, you may **optionally** follow this faction system:

- **SITH** – Red lightsabers only  
- **JEDI** – Blue, purple, green lightsabers  
- **NEUTRAL** – All other saber colors (yellow, white, etc.), the Darksaber, or any non-saber weapon.

> Yes, weapons like the Voulge with glowing blades count as sabers depending on the chosen color.

**Dress however you want**, but faction-themed outfits are encouraged in FFA. Makes it easier to identify who's who — and it just looks cool.

---

## DON’TS
- No fighting in duel zones unless you’re both flourished.
- No spawnkilling or teleport camping.
- No griefing your own faction in FFA.
- No racism, slurs, or toxic behavior — **zero tolerance**.

---

## Final Word
This is a **STAR WARS** server, so a little bit of light roleplay is ALWAYS welcome! PLAY YOUR PART!
**May the Force be with you.**
