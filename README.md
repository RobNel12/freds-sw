# Fred's Fights STARWARS FFA + Duel Rules

## 👥 Player Count Rules
- **< 8 Players:**  
  ➤ Duels-only — no FFA.  
  ➤ Use designated duel zones (accessed via teleporters).  
  ➤ *Flourish (press X) before each duel.*  
  ➤ Wait your turn — respect ongoing duels.  
  ➤ Do not interfere, even if you are in a faction.

- **≥ 8 Players:**  
  ➤ FFA is permitted *only* in the main areas of the map.  
  ➤ Duel zones are still reserved for 1v1s and must remain free of FFA.  
  ➤ Enter duel zones only if you intend to 1v1 and flourish first.

## ⚔️ Duel Zone Etiquette
- Use teleporters to access duel arenas.
- Always **flourish (X)** before engaging in a duel.
- Do not attack anyone inside duel zones unless a duel has been initiated.
- Spectators must wait outside the active arena.
- Killing or harassing duelists in these zones will result in a kick or ban.
