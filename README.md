## ðŸ“œ Rules of the Arena

To ensure everyone enjoys their time in the server, follow these simple rules:

1. **Don't be an ass.**  
   Trash talk is okay, but abuse and bullying are not. Prejudice or discrimination of any kind (language or behavior) will not be tolerated.

2. **Keep FFA out of the main dueling spaces.**  
   You can FFA or mutual RDM with others, but keep it respectful and **away from duels**.

3. **No Random Deathmatch (RDM).**  
   Always **flourish before a duel** and wait for one in return. No revenge RDM either â€” fight with intention, not impulse.

4. **Don't interrupt duels.**  
   This includes:
   - Bodyblocking duelists  
   - Swinging near them (even if you miss) â€” it may trigger an unwanted parry

5. **Fight with honor.**  
   - No healing using `.food` mid-fight  
   - No quick starts â€” give people time to prep  
   - Let your opponent heal to full before resuming, unless they opt out

May the Force guide your blade, and remember: **honor is the true path to victory**.
